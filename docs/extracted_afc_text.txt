Functional Requirements for the U.S. 6 GHz Band under the 
Control of an AFC System 
1 Scope 
The scope of this technical specification is to define the functional requirements for the AFC System, AFC System Operator, Standard Power Access Points, Fixed Client Devices and Proxies 
and to specify the necessary standards to enable test and certification procedures for a properly functioning environment in the 6 GHz band. The functional requirements specified in this 
specification are based on Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules governing the use of 6 GHz band subject to the control of an AFC System, which are codified in Part 15 Subpart E 
of Title 47 the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations [n.1] adopted in the 2021.  
The requirements captured in this specification, outside of the normative annexes, are described in a technology neutral manner and applicable for any unlicensed wireless communication technology operating in the 6 GHz band under the Part 15 Subpart E rules in the 6 GHz band. This specification will be further extended to include the following topics in different normative annexes. 
▪ 
Technology-neutral optional features and the requirements for those features that are not required to be tested for FCC certification; 
▪ 
Technology-specific optional features and the requirements for those features that are required to be tested for FCC certification if implemented by an AFC System, a Proxy, a Standard 
Power Access Point or a Fixed Client Device; and, 
▪ 
Technology-specific optional features and the requirements for those features that are not  required to be tested for the FCC certification. 
The FCC’s Part 15 Subpart E rules will hereafter be referred to as “the FCC Rules”, “the Rules”  or “Part 15” and reference to specific items in the rules will be given in the form of, for example, 
15.407(k)(16) if from Part 15. 
NOTE 1: Not all the 6 GHz-specific rules are captured in this specification as  this document is not a comprehensive list of requirements for the 
implementation or operation of an AFC System, Proxy, Standard Power Access Point or Fixed Client Device. AFC System operation, 
components and/or devices, as applicable, are expected to comply with the rules that are not considered in this specification. 
NOTE 2: Unless otherwise specified, “Standard Power Access Point” and g“Fixed Client Device” are collectively referred to as “Standard Power 
Device” in this document.

3.1 
Definitions 
3.1.1 FCC Definitions 
The Wireless Innovation Forum 6 GHz Committee leverages the definitions provided by the 
FCC from 47 CFR 15.403. These definitions and others are also available at reference [n.1]. 
Access Point (AP): A U-NII transceiver that operates either as a bridge in a peer-to-peer 
connection or as a connector between the wired and wireless segments of the network or as a 
relay between wireless network segments. 
Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) System: A system that automatically determines and 
provides lists of which frequencies are available for use by Standard Power Access Points 
operating in the 5.925-6.425 GHz and 6.525-6.875 GHz bands. 
NOTE: Although not explicitly stated in the definition, the AFC System provides 
lists of which frequencies are available for use by Fixed Client Devices 
in the same way as to Standard Power Access Points operating in the

5.925-6.425 GHz and 6.525-6.875 GHz bands. (See the definition of 
Fixed Client Device) 
Client Device: A U-NII device whose transmissions are generally under the control of an Access 
Point and is not capable of initiating a network. 
Fixed Client Device: A Client Device intended as customer premise equipment that is 
permanently attached to a structure, operates only on channels provided by an AFC System, has 
a geolocation capability, and complies with antenna pointing angle requirements. 
NOTE: WInnForum believes that the FCC allows a Fixed Client Device to 
operate as a Client Device in accordance with 15.407(a)(7), 
15.407(d)(5) and 15.407(d)(7), and, while doing so, to 
communicate with an AFC System. 
Maximum Power Spectral Density: The Maximum Power Spectral Density is the maximum 
Power Spectral Density, within the specified measurement bandwidth, within the U-NII device 
operating band. 
Power Spectral Density: The Power Spectral Density is the total energy output per unit 
bandwidth from a Pulse or sequence of Pulses for which the transmit power is at its maximum 
level, divided by the total duration of the Pulses. This total time does not include the time 
between Pulses during which the transmit power is off or below its maximum level. 
Pulse: A Pulse is a continuous transmission of a sequence of modulation symbols, during which 
the average symbol envelope power is constant. 
Standard Power Access Point: An Access Point that operates in the 5.925-6.425 GHz and 6.525-
6.875 GHz bands pursuant to direction from an Automated Frequency Coordination System. 
U-NII devices: Intentional radiators operating in the frequency bands 5.15-5.35 GHz, 5.470-5.85 
GHz, 5.925-7.125 GHz that use wideband digital modulation techniques and provide a wide 
array of high data rate mobile and fixed communications for individuals, businesses, and 
institutions. 
3.1.2 WInnForum Definitions 
AFC System Operator: An entity designated by the Commission to operate an AFC System in 
accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in the Part 15 Subpart E. 
Available Channel: A Channel, determined by an AFC System, on which a Standard Power 
Device is allowed to operate at its geographic coordinates.  
NOTE: For the purpose of this document, the WInnForum definition of 
Available Channel takes precedence over the definition in the 47 
CFR Part 15 Subpart E [n.1] since the FCC-defined Available 
Channel applies only in the context of its DFS rules.

FS Link Path: A sequence of Segments between a fixed service transmitter and a fixed service 
receiver.  
Passive Sites: A terminology collectively referring to 1) a passive repeater consisting of back-to-
back antennas connected to each other by waveguide or cable, 2) a single billboard reflector, or 
3) a double passive reflector consisting of two billboard reflectors typically less than 120 meters 
from each other. 
NOTE: Double passive reflectors are treated as two single billboard reflectors as per 
R2-AIP-31.  
Proxy: A network entity engaging in communications with an AFC System on behalf of one or 
more Standard Power Devices, or networks of such devices. 
NOTE: The WInnForum has defined this terminology such that it becomes equivalent 
to the term “network element representing multiple Standard Power Access 
Points or Fixed Client Devices” or “network element device representing 
multiple Standard Power Access Points or Fixed Client Devices” used by the 
FCC in some of the rules. For R0 requirements using these terms, “[Proxy]” is 
inserted for clarification purposes. 
Segment: A path within an FS Link between a fixed service transmitter and a fixed service 
receiver (when there are no Passive Sites), between a fixed service transmitter and a Passive Site, 
between two Passive Sites, or between a Passive Site and a fixed service receiver.  
NOTE: For an FS Link Path without any Passive Site, the FS Link Path has a single 
segment between the fixed service transmitter and receiver. For an FS Link Path 
containing n Passive Sites, it has n+1 Segments between the transmitter and 
receiver, where the first Segment is from the fixed service transmitter to the first 
Passive Site, the next Segment is from the first Passive Site to the second 
Passive Site and so on. The final Segment ends at the fixed service receiver. 
Server Certificate: A digital certificate issued to a server for the purpose of authenticating its 
identity and creating secure communication channels to its clients. 
Standard Power Device: A terminology collectively referring to Standard Power Access Point 
and Fixed Client Device. 
NOTE: In this document, this terminology is used for R1, R2 and R3 requirements.  
Trusted CA: A certificate authority (CA) which has been proven to be secure by an external 
WebTrust audit or equivalent (e.g., ETSI EN 319 403 [i.9]). 
NOTE: Example policies against which such audit would occur are CA/Browser 
Forum Baseline Requirements [i.10] and WINNF-TS-0022 [i.11].

Annex E (Informative): Data Interpolation Methods for Fixed Service 
Receiver Antenna and Passive Sites 
E.1 Linear Interpolation for Fixed Service Antenna RPE 
This informative annex provides the information about the Appendix A (App01) (in .xlsx format) 
of WINNF-TS-1014 which is used for FS receiver near field adjustment specified in R2-AIP-17.  
The Appendix lists the difference, in dB, between the near field and far field RPE of a parabolic 
dish antenna assuming a Hansen single parameter dish illumination. This difference in the near 
and far field is a function of three parameters: 1) antenna illumination efficiency, 2) normalized 
distance from the antenna and 3) the discrimination parameter.  
The antenna illumination efficiency is defined as the ratio of the far field boresight gain for a 
given illumination to the gain of the antenna with a uniform illumination [i.8]. This efficiency 
can be expressed in dB or as a simple ratio. For a Hansen illumination, the efficiency  is a 
function of its H parameter.  The table below lists the H parameter for a number of efficiencies.

The normalized distance x and the discrimination parameter u can be calculated as follows: 
x = d/(2D2),  
u = (D/) sin,  
where: 
▪ 
D: the diameter of the dish antenna; 
▪ 
: the wavelength of the microwave signal; 
▪ 
d: the distance from the fixed service microwave antenna;  
▪ 
 the discrimination angle from boresight;  
▪ 
x can be expressed in dB as 10log10(x); and  
▪ 
all distances are expressed in the same units. 
A different tab is present in the Appendix A for 18 different normalized distances expressed in 
dB ranging from 0 dB (x = 1) to -17 dB (x = 0.02). On each tab the near field - far field 
difference is listed for the seven efficiencies in the table above as a function of the discrimination 
parameter. A properly interpolated value from these curves can be used to estimate the near field

RPE from the far field RPE given an efficiency, normalized distance and discrimination 
parameter. 
Steps to interpolate the data are as follows: 
1. First determine the fixed service antenna efficiency along with the discrimination parameter 
and the normalized distance in dB to the interference source. Then, find the two worksheets 
in the workbook that bracket the normalized distance. If the normalized distance is greater 
than or equal to 0 dB, no near field adjustment is needed, and no further calculations are 
necessary. If the normalized distance is less than -17 dB, use the -17 dB worksheet. 
2. Next find the two column pairs on each worksheet that bracket the antenna efficiency (). If 
the efficiency is less than 0.4, use the 0.4 column pair. If the efficiency is greater than 0.7, 
use the 0.7 column pair. 
o 
In the left column of each column pair, find the two discrimination parameter (u) values 
that bracket the discrimination parameter. If the discrimination parameter is greater than 
the largest value listed in the column, use an adjustment factor value of zero. Otherwise 
use linear interpolation between the two bracketing values and the desired 
discrimination parameter for each column pair.   
o 
If working with two column pairs in a worksheet, use linear interpolation between the 
two determined column values for the desired antenna efficiency. This is the adjustment 
factor associated with the worksheet. 
o 
If working with two worksheets, use linear interpolation between the two adjustment 
factors for each worksheet and the desired normalized distance in dB. This will result in 
the final adjustment factor to be added to the far field RPE value at the discrimination 
angle. 
E.2 Linear Interpolation for Passive Sites 
In R2-AIP-31, the near field dB value of n can be interpolated from the supplementary tabulated 
data with the following procedure. To determine the value of n for particular 1/Ks and Q values, 
the nearest surrounding values of these parameters can be found in column A and row 1 of the 
Appendix B (App02). Then bilinear interpolation is used to find n. Assuming these surrounding 
values are given by: 
1/KS1 ≤1/KS ≤ 1/KS2 
Q1 < Q ≤ Q2 
Then,  
n(1/KS, Q) = wK1wQ1n(1/KS1, Q1) + wK2wQ1n(1/KS2 Q1) + wK1wQ2n(1/KS1, Q2) 
+ wK2wQ2n(1/KS2, Q2) 
Where the n(1/KSi, Qj) dB values come from the appropriate row and column of the tabulated data 
and the weights are defined as: 
wK1= 1 KS2

Annex F (Normative): Considerations for 6 GHz AFC Use of NLCD Data 
NLCD data with 30 m × 30 m pixels, which includes the 48 contiguous United States (CONUS) 
and Alaska, shall be processed using the data adjustment technique as described in F.3.1 of this 
Annex. The other part of this Annex provides more information about the technique. 
F.1 Introduction 
The USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) can be downloaded at: 
https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3Aland%20cover  
From that site, 30 m × 30 m pixel NLCD data can be downloaded for the contiguous 48 US 
states (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Additionally, newer high resolution NLCD 
data can also be downloaded for Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands from the NOAA 
web sites at: 
https://chs.coast.noaa.gov/htdata/raster1/landcover/bulkdownload/hires/hi/  
https://chs.coast.noaa.gov/htdata/raster1/landcover/bulkdownload/hires/pr/  
https://chs.coast.noaa.gov/htdata/raster1/landcover/bulkdownload/hires/usvi/  
The legacy data sets from 2021 and earlier are provided as ERDAS Image (.img) files. The more 
modern data set versions are in GeoTiff format. The data is provided in several different map 
projections/datums depending on the source and region.  The USGS data comes in different 
Albers Conic Equal Area projections. While the NOAA data comes as Universal Transverse 
Mercator (UTM) projections, or in the case of Puerto Rico, a 1983 state plane projection based 
on a Lambert Conic Two Parallel projection. The table below summarizes the most modern data 
available from the USGS and NOAA for these regions.

The USGS data specifies its pixels as one of 20 different NLCD classes or a value of unclassified 
(see Table 15). The NOAA data specifies its pixels as one of 27 different NLCD classes plus two 
undefined values of unclassified and map background.  The USGS NLCD integer classification 
values range from 0 to 95 and are grouped in categories, so that not all integers in this range are 
used.  The NOAA NLCD integer classification values simply range from 0 to 28. It is possible to 
map the NOAA NLCD classes to equivalent or similar USGS NLCD classes (see  
Table 16).

Consequently, this document will only be concerned with the USGS NLCD classification integer 
values. 
To use any of these data sets with latitude/longitude co-ordinates, those co-ordinates must first 
be converted to the projection/datum of the data set. Then the pixel within the data set 
corresponding to those new co-ordinates identified. Now in addition to the NLCD data, the 
USGS also provides terrain elevation data for the same regions. Furthermore, the USGS terrain 
elevation data uses a NAD83 latitude/longitude projection, specifying the average terrain 
elevation in 1 arc-second × 1 arc-second pixels.  In order to simplify working with both the 
USGS terrain data and the NLCD data, the Wi-Fi Alliance published re-pixelated NLCD data

also using the same 1 arc-second × 1 arc-second pixels. This data is available at their GitHub site 
at: 
https://github.com/Wi-FiTestSuite/6GHz-AFC/tree/main/NLCD_data  
Note, as the 2021 CONUS NLCD data was only published recently in July 2023, the Wi-Fi 
Alliance re-pixelated data is based on the 2019 CONUS NLCD data. 
F.2 Land Clutter Classifications 
When making propagation loss calculations in a 6 GHz AFC System, the NLCD data values 
come into play in two situations. For propagation paths less than 1 km using the WINNER II 
model, the NLCD class determines if the urban, suburban or rural version of the model should be 
used.  For propagation paths over 1 km using the ITM model, the NLCD class determines if the 
ITU-R P.2108 or P.452 clutter model should be used. Furthermore, if the P.452 model is used, 
the NLCD class also determines which row of P.452 table 4 to draw the model parameters from. 
When computing loss due to clutter, either for ITM or within WINNER II, there is a hierarchy to 
the NLCD classifications, ranging from minimum loss to maximum loss. This hierarchy is 
shown in the table below. As one moves down the rows in the table, more clutter loss will be 
predicted in the propagation calculation.  Hence the higher rows in the table are more 
conservative with less clutter loss, and lower rows are less conservative with more clutter loss 
predicted.

F.3 Roads in Rural Areas 
A careful review of the USGS NLCD data has shown that many of the NLCD re-pixelation 
problems occurred around roads in rural areas. The USGS typically classifies paved roads as 
suburban (21 or 22) or urban (23 or 24). This is problematic since roads are not above ground 
structures that hinder the propagation of radio waves and cause the clutter loss assumed in 
suburban or urban environments. And where roads run through rural areas, there are 
suburban/urban pixels adjacent to rural pixels where re-pixelation issues may arise.  
It is much more realistic to treat roads running through rural areas as having the clutter loss 
associated with the surrounding rural environment.  However, the challenge is to identify the

suburban/urban pixels that are roads in rural areas compared to those pixels that are within actual 
towns and cities with buildings and ground structures. 
After some experimentation a simple technique has been devised that, although not perfect, 
seems to work reasonably well with the road pixels in rural areas. This technique will be 
described next.   
F.3.1 Data Adjustment Technique 
The technique identifies suburban or urban pixels that are on roads in rural areas and then 
demotes them from their suburban or urban classification to the surrounding rural classification. 
After this modification, the data can be re-pixelated into square arc-second pixels aligned to 
latitude and longitude.  The original NLCD pixels are identified as being on roads by looking for 
thin paths of suburban/urban pixels that are surrounded on both sides by rural pixels.  
This identification is accomplished by looking at a 5 by 5 grid of pixels and considering how to 
treat the center pixel. If the center pixel is not a suburban/urban classification, there is nothing to 
do, and it is left unmodified. If the center pixel is suburban or urban the eight pixels immediately 
surrounding it are examined. If none of the eight are rural, again there is nothing to do, and 
center pixel is left unmodified. However, if one or more of the surrounding eight pixels is rural, 
the center pixel under consideration becomes a candidate to be demoted to that rural 
classification.  If there are different rural classes in the surrounding eight pixels, one of the most 
conservative classes from the set will be used, according to the hierarchy in Table 17. To 
determine if a candidate should be demoted, the 16 outer edge pixels are examined. Traversing 
this ring of pixels in a clockwise direction, the number of transitions from rural to 
suburban/urban pixels and back again are counted. If there are at least two transitions in both 
directions in a complete loop around the outer edge of pixels, this implies rural pixels are on 
either side of a path of suburban/urban pixels within the 5 by 5 grid.  In this situation the center 
pixel would be demoted to the rural classification. If there are fewer than two transitions in each 
direction, the center pixel is left unchanged. 
This technique is applied to every pixel in the NLCD data by looking at the 5 × 5 grid where it 
is the center pixel.  Note that the NLCD pixels in the 48 contiguous United States and Alaska are 
30 m × 30 m in size and so, the width of most roads is roughly one or two pixels. This method 
would likely not be as effective with significantly different sized pixels.   
F.3.2 Example Calculations 
Consider the 5 × 5 grid of NLCD pixels along a road shown in Figure 1. The yellow pixels 
represent rural, while the red pixels are urban.

Figure 1: Example 1 – NLCD pixels 
The center pixel is urban (red) so the surrounding eight pixels are examined.  Of these, three are 
rural (yellow), so the center pixel becomes a candidate to be demoted to the rural (yellow) 
classification.  So next the ring of 16 outer pixels is examined along the path shown by the grey 
line.  Starting in the upper left corner and heading right, there is a transition from rural to urban.  
Then heading down along the right side, a transition from urban to rural.  And heading to the left 
along the bottom row of pixels a transition back to urban.  Finally heading up along the left side 
of the grid there is one more transition from urban to rural.  As there are two transitions from 
rural to urban and two transitions from urban back to rural, the center pixel is demoted to the 
rural classification. 
Consider now the 5 × 5 grid of pixels centered on an urban pixel at the edge of a city as shown in 
Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2: Example 2 – NLCD pixels 
The center pixel is urban (red) so the surrounding eight pixels are examined. Of these, two are 
rural (yellow), so the center pixel becomes a candidate to be demoted to the rural (yellow) 
classification.  So next the ring of 16 outer pixels is examined along the path shown by the grey

line.  Starting in the upper left corner and heading right, there is a transition from rural to urban.  
Then heading down along the right side and left along the bottom, no transitions. Finally heading 
up along the left side of the grid there is a transition from urban to rural. As there is only one 
transition from rural to urban and one transition from urban back to rural, the center pixel is left 
unmodified. 
F.3.3 Example Results 
The following figures show a rural area around the town of Newton, Illinois. Here there are several 
roads through the rural countryside. In the original 2019 NLCD data these road pixels are color 
coded pink (suburban) and red (urban). The cluster of pink and red pixels in the central northern 
portion of the figures is the town of Newton. Pixels of other colors are different rural classifications 
as described in Figure 5.  As can be seen in these figures, the roads in the original data are demoted 
to their surrounding rural classification, while the pixels in the town of Newton remain essentially 
unchanged.
